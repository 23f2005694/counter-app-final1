# Auto-generated README (Round 1)

**Project brief:** Make a small web app where users can enter a bill amount and select a tip percentage. Calculate and display the tip amount and total bill dynamically as the user types or selects a tip. Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for interactivity. Keep the layout simple and mobile-friendly. Host it on GitHub Pages so itâ€™s accessible anywhere
